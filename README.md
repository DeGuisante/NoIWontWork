### What is No I Won't Work?

This is my pet project with intentionally dumb solutions from a "real" web development perspective — for example, all the code is in a single HTML file without any compilation via Vite or Webpack. This is done on purpose.

It's a Three.js game where Colorman tries to do his work for a measly 40 rubles while trying not to piss off Nikita, his employer.

Currently, the game is in an unplayable state, but I'll polish it up in the future and it will be in a playable state!
